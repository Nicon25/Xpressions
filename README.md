# Xpressions of Twitter - Sentiment Analysis at Scale

In the era of large data, X (ex-Twitter) has become a very valuable instrument for researching what the public thinks and feels. This project is based on the datasets, including 1’600’000 tweets. 

The goal is to carry out **sentiment analysis** of tweet data utilizing sophisticated data processing techniques and models to obtain informative output. It relies on technologies such as **Hadoop, Spark, MongoDB, and Python** from the very beginning (EDA and pre-processing) to the end (modelling and analysis). 

The findings of this research not only contribute to a deeper understanding of sentiment dynamics on social media but also offer insights into optimizing data processing pipelines and modelling techniques for future endeavours in sentiment analysis and big data analytics.

### Tools & Technologies
